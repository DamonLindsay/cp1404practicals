## 1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

I believe my performance improved as I progressed, but I acknowledge there's still room for improvement in my reporting
accuracy. During the break, I plan to continue coding and aim to further refine my ability to predict workload
accurately.

## 2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

I've garnered valuable insights through code reviews, receiving constructive feedback and offering insightful critiques.
It's fascinating to observe how others approached the same tasks I worked on, allowing for comparisons to determine
improvements or alternative approaches.

## 3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I'd suggest eliminating Practical 7... On a more serious note, I found great value in all the programming content. Is
there a resource available where I can find answers to the extension questions? As of now, I'm not aware of such a
resource.

## 4. Include proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
