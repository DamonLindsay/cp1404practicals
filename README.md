# CP1404 Practicals

This repository is where all work done for the CP1404 practicals are.

The author of this repository is Damon Lindsay, currently a first year IT student @ JCU.

## 3 Main Lessons I've Learned so Far...

- **Readability Matters**: Use descriptive variable names, use verbs when creating function names, and adhere to PEP8
  standards.
- **Consistency and Structure**: Maintain consistent coding throughout any projects, like naming conventions. Remember
  SRP and break code down into smaller, single purpose designs.
- **Documentation and Comments**: Use docstrings to describe functions, classes and modules, providing clear
  explanations. Use comments where necessary, but strive to write self-explanatory code firstly.
